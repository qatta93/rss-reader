## Displaying on Mobile:
To view the app on your mobile device, use Expo Go:

1. Install Expo Go on your phone from the App Store or Google Play.

2. Open Expo Go on your device.

3. Scan the QR code displayed in your terminal after running `npm start` or `npx expo start -c`.

This will load the app directly on your mobile device for easy testing and viewing.

## How the App Works:
The app pulls RSS feeds from various sources, such as the default NASA Breaking News feed, and displays the articles. Each article can be marked as read or unread. Articles can also be added to a list of favorites for easy access.

All data, such as feed URLs and article statuses, are saved locally using `AsyncStorage`. This allows the app to persist your preferences even after it is closed and reopened.
